CSV File Reader, Rory Nicholas, 29/03/2021

This project will open csv files and display them in a table, with options to remove
certain fields or sort the data in ascending or descending order. In order to run and use
the program, please follow these steps:

1. Compile the program by navigating to the directory called 'src', in which the files are stored.
   Then, use the command 'javac Main.java'.

2. Run the program by using the command 'java Main'. If you are a tired professor who has eye strain
   from marking lots of coursework, you may include the word 'dark' to activate the dark mode. This
   would make the full command 'java Main dark' (case sensitive).

3. A window will open containing a load button. Pressing this button will open a file explorer, in
   which you may navigate to and choose the file you wish to load. This must be a csv file.

4. A new window will open displaying the data stored in the csv file. 
   You may:
      Check and uncheck the boxes on the left to show or hide certain fields of information. Click refresh to enact these choices.
      Click on the up and down arrows next to the checkboxes to sort the corresponding field lexicographically in ascending or descending order.
      Use the load button again to load a different file.
